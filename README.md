# ArizonaSunshineLIV
Adds LIV support to Arizona Sunshine (after DLC update), allowing for mixed reality capture or avatars in third person.

Historically the game had legacy/quads mixed reality support that was removed with the DLC update.

# Installation and use
- Download MelonLoader Installer and install 0.5.7 in Arizona Sunshine folder.
- From the [ArizonaSunshineLIV release zip](https://github.com/Jas2o/ArizonaSunshineLIV/releases), extract the folder Mods into Arizona Sunshine folder.
- (v1.0.0) In Steam's game properties for ArizonaSunshine, set the launch options: -mr
- Start the game from Steam.
- From LIV, change Capture tab to Manual and select ArizonaSunshine.exe (not Melon Loader).

# Issues not caused by mod or LIV
Not seeing anything anything between intro logos and menu/caravan?
- Try wearing the headset until you see the game's tracker input select screen (e.g. for Hyperkin Hyper Blaster).
- Look at the Ignore button until this screen disappears.
- You should now be able to see the the menu/caravan. Now you can put the headset down if you need to adjust/do something.
