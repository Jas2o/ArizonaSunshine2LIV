# ArizonaSunshineLIV
Adds LIV support to Arizona Sunshine (after DLC update), allowing for mixed reality capture or avatars in third person.

Historically the game had legacy/quads mixed reality support that was removed with the DLC update.

# Installation and use
- Download MelonLoader Installer and install 0.5.7 in Arizona Sunshine folder.
- From the [ArizonaSunshineLIV release zip](https://github.com/Jas2o/ArizonaSunshineLIV/releases), extract the folder Mods into Arizona Sunshine folder.
- Start the game from Steam.
- From LIV, change Capture tab to Manual and select ArizonaSunshine.exe (not Melon Loader).
